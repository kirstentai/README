Hello, I'm Kirsten.

I'm a final year Bachelor of Data Science student interested in software engineering and building ML products.

In here you'll find projects I've worked on for fun.

I deployed a [REST API to Heroku with Python and Flask](https://github.com/kirstentai/flask-heroku-restapi).

I'm currently working on [Seed Speculator](https://github.com/kirstentai/seed-speculator), an app that takes a startup PDF pitch deck and predicts amount raised.
