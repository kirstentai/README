Hello, I'm Kirsten.

I'm a final year Bachelor of Data Science student interested in software engineering and building ML products. Earlier this 2021, I was a data analyst intern for First Circle, where I led and built an OCR product to help approve loans within a day by reducing document processing time. I also conducted sentiment analysis on FC's Zendesk customer data to help Sales increase efficacy.

In here you'll find projects I've worked on for fun.

I deployed a [REST API](https://github.com/kirstentai/flask-heroku-restapi) to Heroku and built it with Python and Flask.

I'm currently working on [Seed Speculator](https://github.com/kirstentai/seed-speculator), an app that takes a startup PDF pitch deck and predicts amount raised.
